## 1.3. Scope and Objectives of Use Case

*Scope and objectives of use case*

|||
| --- | --- |
| Scope | The scope of the UC is to examine the integration and operational use of low cost PMUs in order to increase network observability collecting measurement data such as voltage, current and phases in various points of the distribution network. More in detail, the DSO will use the data collected to improve the operation of the tools and services developed within the project by exploiting increased data granularity. Furthermore, the data coming from various sources and systems of the DSO should be integrated in the DSO Technical Platform and a User Interface (UI) should be developed to allow the DSO personnel to use the available tools and services. <br/>  In addition, all the available data should be further delivered for use by tools and services developed in order to support flexibility mechanisms. All the appropriate communication protocols should be integrated and tested to develop a unique point of data delivery to various actors involved in the project. |
| **Objective(s)** | * To increase network observability. <br/> * To integrate data coming from different sources in the DSO Technical Platform.|

***Notes:***
* **Scope** - describes the aims and boundaries of the use case in a short, precise text.
* **Objective(s)** - goals of the use case, in form of bullet points and a short headline.
* **Realted business case(s)** - optional

## 1.4. Narrative of Use Case


**Short description**
PMUs are installed in critical network nodes to increase network observability. PMU measurements along with other DSO data (network topology, customer loads, etc) are integrated in the DSO Technical Platform to be visulalised in a User Interface (UI), so that DSO can make use of tools and services developed in the project.

**Complete description**

The DSO operates the distribution network and handles the data sources coming from various systems such as SCADA/DMS, AMR, GIS etc. Data coming from various sources get integrated into the Open DSO Technical Platform providing an adequate level of network observability. Low cost PMUs are deployed in Mesogia area in critical network points and nodes where there is limited observability or a requirement to have an increased awareness such as DER and prosumers bidirectional power flows. Also, PMU data are integrated in the DSO Technical Platform following a data collection plan that serves the functionalities of the flexibility tools and services. Measurements from PMUs  enhance network awareness in terms of data granularity and number of nodes observed in a cost effective manner. Also, the open DSO Technical Platform performs the correlation of the data coming from different sources and systems during real time, providing to the DSO the technical capacity for flexibility mechanisms support and a User Interface (UI) where the aforementioned is visualised.

***Notes:***
* **Relation to other use cases** - relation to other use cases in the same project or thematic area. Possible relation types are for instance include, extend, invoke, or associate.
* **Level of depth** - reflects the degree of specialisation of the use case. Although no common notation is settled, descriptions like high level use case, generic, detailed, or specialised use case are often used.
* **Prioritisation** - helps to rate the use cases in a project from very important to nice-to-have with labels like obligatory/mandatory or optional which have to be agreed upon beforehand.
* **Generic, regional or national relation** - for the purpose of generalisation if use case is applied to areas where restictions by law or silimiar issues occur.
* **Nature of the use cases** - describes the viewpoint and field of attention like *technical, political, business/market, test*, etc.

***Notes***
This part describes the possible scenarios of the use case. The scenarios should comply with the sequence diagrams in Sect. 2 of the template, so that every step describes one part of a communication or action. Apart from a normal success scenario, different failure scenarios or alternatives can be included to describe situations where preconditions are not satisfied or unwanted states are attained.
* **Primary Actor** - the first actor appearing in the scenario at the incident causing the scenario to begin.
* **Triggering Event** - the incident causing the scenario to begin.
* **Pre-Condition** - indicates which terms have to be fulfilled for the scenario to be executed.
* **Post-Condition** - indicates which terms should be valid after the scenario. TIt can also specify whether a scenario has been successfully completed or not.
